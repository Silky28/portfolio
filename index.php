					<span>Constantly improving my skills is what I do</span>
					<p>Talking about your own skills is hard, because you can find that they are good while someone else thinks you still have room for improvement.</p>
					<p>Constantly learning is one of the basic things with creative design and front-end development. When you stop learning you stop moving forward in this world, so that's what I do.</p>
					<p> Learning from others and reading articles and about new techniques on the internet is the best way to keep yourself up to date. Always trying to improve my existing coding skills and to learn new by following tutorials on websites.</p>
